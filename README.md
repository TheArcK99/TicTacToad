# TicTacToad
Basic machine learning project where I trained an algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe!
Utilized Python and Keras to build the game and neural network.
Built the game, designed a model, trained the model, simulated the game 20k times(took a couple of hours) and outputted the resuts onto a txt.
